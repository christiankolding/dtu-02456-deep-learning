kramer : they try to push you into using their cleaning crew , with all their so called maintenance equipment . 
jerry : that old scam . 
kramer : yeah , well that ' s why i ' m doing it all myself . this parenting isn ' t about delegating responsibility , it ' s about being there . 
jerry : at the side of the road , with a pile of garbage . 
kramer : quality time . 
george : keys . i can ' t find my keys . 
jerry : you lost phil rizzuto ' s head ? !

delivery boy : you really live here ? 
elaine : oh yeah . handing over money there you go , keep the change . bye now . i ' ll see you . 
elaine : at the boy ' s back this isn ' t fair . this is address discrimination ! 
jerry : well , i cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf . 
george : so the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth ? 
jerry : by the time i ' m through with her mouth , she ' ll be able to eat off it . is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it ? 
george : no , stings the throat . anyway , so i was coming along here , and i felt like a piece of cake , you know ? but then i thought , it ' s morning , i should really have a muffin . i like those chocolate chip ones . then i figured , well , they ' re really both cake . so i , uh , i sat on that bench for a little while , twenty minutes or an hour , and then i figured , check and see what you were up to . a thought occurs to him wait a minute , wait a minute . the broad jump ! the broad jump over the pothole on eighty sixth street ! 
george : now i remember , as i jumped over the hole i heard a , like a jingling sound . 
jerry : you didn ' t look down ? 
george : i was trying to stick the landing . indistinct was right around here . 
george : no ! no ! ! 
head o . c . : holy , holy cow ! 
jerry : poor son of a bitch . 
jerry : it ' s a hundred thousand revolutions a second . it ' s the most powerful one they make . 
jenna : it ' s like i ' m holding a blender . 
jerry : the engine ' s made by mcdonnell douglas . 
jerry : oh no , you keep going . it shuts off automatically . 
jenna : restarting and reapplying the brush really , it does ? 
jerry : unheard by jenna when the battery runs out . 
jenna : shouting to jerry i was really happy with my old toothbrush . 
jerry : no , trust me , that one was doing more harm than good . don ' t forget to use the plax too . 
jenna o . c . : that stuff tastes like bleach ! 
jerry : i don ' t know anything about that . 
jenna : mmm . my mouth feels so clean . 
jerry : that ' s the idea . 
jerry : you know , maybe we better not . i , i think i ' m getting a little cold . i don ' t wanna give you any of my germs . 
jenna : aww . okay . thanks , i guess . 
elaine : you still couldn ' t kiss her ? 
jerry : she has a taint . i can ' t see it , but i know it ' s there . 
elaine : oh , so now you ' re finding fault on a sub atomic level . 
jerry : maybe if i could shrink myself down , like in fantastic voyage , and get inside a microscopic submarine , i could be sure . although if there was something there , it might be pretty scary . course , i would have that laser . 
elaine : jer , do you see where this is going ? 
jerry : being really clean and happy ? 
elaine : jerry , you have tendencies . they ' re always annoying , but they were just tendencies . but now , if you can ' t kiss this girl , i ' m afraid we ' re talking disorder . 
jerry : disorder ? 
elaine : and from disorder , you ' re a quirk or two away from full on dementia . 
jerry : thoughtful hmm , that could hurt me . pointing out of window hey , there it is . 
elaine : shall we stop and say hi ? 
jerry : nah , we ' ve seen it . 
elaine : yeah . 
kramer : shouting after car hey jerry ! yeah , i ' ll see you back at the house !

man : wha ? what d ' you want ? 
elaine : you see , there ' s this certain flounder and they won ' t deliver it to my side of the street . 
man : wh , when is that ?

jerry : hey . so , keys ? 
george : no keys . and i been calling the city all day . course there ' s not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole . 
jerry : i guess they leave that up to the general population . 
george : i tell you this . if the real phil rizzuto was down there , this wouldn ' t be happening ! 
jerry : hard to say . 
kramer : hey , you need some roadwork done ? ' cos i met some maintenance guys today on the highway , they could probably help you out .

jenna : what ? ! 
jerry : nothing . i just , i uh , i bruised my lip . i was drinking a celray , and i brought it up too fast and i banged it into my lip , lower voice and hurriedly and then i knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and i wasn ' t able to tell you before you could use it . 
jenna : what ? 
jerry : i ' m sorry . 
jenna : when were you gonna tell me this ? ! 
jerry : obviously never .

jerry : hey , what were you doing with that bus yesterday ? 
kramer : here you go , here you go , check it out . 
jerry : the real peterman reality bus tour . i ' m confused . 
kramer : peterman ' s book is big business . people want to know the stories behind the stories . 
jerry : nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person ' s life . 
kramer : i ' m only charging $<N> . <N> , plus you get a pizza bagel and desert . 
george : what ' s desert ? 
kramer : bite size three musketeers . just like the real peterman eats . 
george : he eats those ? 
kramer : no . i eat those . i ' m the real peterman . 
george : i think i understand this . jay peterman is real . his biography is not . now , you kramer are real . 
kramer : talk to me . 
george : but your life is peterman ' s . now the bus tour , which is real , takes to places that , while they are real , they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* peterman which is you . 
kramer : understand ? 
jerry : yeah . $<N> . <N> for a three musketeers . 
mr . lippman : elaine . i ' m in over my head . nobody likes my muffin tops . 
elaine : so ? what do you want me to do about it ? 
mr . lippman : you ' re the muffin top expert , tell me what i ' m doing wrong . 
elaine : mr . lippman , when i worked for you at pendent publishing , i believed in you , you know as a man of integrity . but , i saw you in that paper hat and that aprin 
mr . lippman : what if i cut you in for <N>% of the profits ? 
elaine : deal . here ' s your problem . you ' re making just the muffin tops . you ' ve gotta make the *whole* muffin . then you pop the top , toss the stump . taste . 
mr . lippman : ah . takes a bite of the top . mmmmm . ah hah ? 
elaine : yeah . 
mr . lippman : so what do we with the bottoms ? 
elaine : i don ' t know , give em to a soup kitchen . 
mr . lippman : that ' s a good idea . 
elaine : and one more thing , you really think we need the exclamation point ? because , it ' s not top of the muffin *to you ! * 
mr . lippman : no . no . it is . 
kramer : hey jerry . what is this ? lady gillette ? what ' s going on ? 
jerry : what ? can ' t i get a moment ' s peace ? 
kramer : what are you doing to yourself ? 
jerry : i can ' t stop . alex thinks i ' m naturally hairless . 
kramer : you can ' t keep this up . don ' t you know what ' s going to happen ? everytime you shave it , it ' s going to come in thicker and fuller and darker . 
jerry : oh that ' s an old wives tale . 
kramer : is it ? look at this . 
kramer : high pitched voice look at it ! look at it ! and it ' s all me . i shaved there when i was a lifeguard . 
jerry : oh come on . that ' s genetics . that ' s not going to happen to me . 
kramer : won ' t it ? or is it already starting to happen ? 
elaine : wow . look at this . we ' re cleaning up . 
lippman : oh , rubin , get me another tray of lowfat cranberry . 
rebecca : excuse me , i ' m rebecca demore from the homeless shelter . 
elaine : oh , hi . 
rebecca : are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter ? 
elaine : you been enjoying them ? 
rebecca : they ' re just stumps . 
elaine : well they ' re perfectly edible . 
rebecca : oh , so you just assume that the homeless will eat them , they ' ll eat anything ? 
mr . lippman : no no , we just thought 
rebecca : i know what you thought . they don ' t have homes , they don ' t have jobs , what do they need the top of a muffin for ? they ' re lucky to get the stumps . 
elaine : if the homeless don ' t like them the homeless don ' t have to eat them . 
rebecca : the homeless don ' t like them . 
elaine : fine . 
rebecca : we ' ve never gotten so many complaints . every two minutes , where is the top of this muffin ? who ate the rest of this ? 
elaine : we were just trying to help . 
rebecca : why don ' t you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells . 
elaine : i think i might . 
mary anne : i can ' t believe you found something so quickly . how much you pay ? 
george : $<N> . 
mary anne : ouch . a month ? 
george : yeah . 
mary anne : well , guess that ' s all right for now , but if you say here for more than a few months , you ' re a real sucker . 
george : yeah , well i uh got lots of other stuff to show you too . wait till you see the plum job that i landed . 
mary anne : yeah . we should let this place air out anyway . it smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something . 
kramer : comming up on the right , if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window . it ' s the one that ' s covered in chicken wire . 
woman : hey if you ' re the real peterman , who come you ' re wearing those ratty clothes ? the ' re not very romantic . 
kramer : over the speaker well that ' s your opinion . 
man <N> : can i have another three musketeers ? they ' re rather small . 
kramer : forget it . okay newman ' s postal route is around here somewhere . 
man <N> : who ' s newman ? 
man <N> : who cares . 
man <N> : hey fake peterman , let me off . i ' m nautious . 
man <N> : can i have his candy bar ? 
kramer : ahh . everyone just settle down . we have three hours left on this thing , and i can ' t drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time . okay . lomez ' s place of worship is right on the right here . 
jerry : why do i have to go on the tour ? 
kramer : jerry you ' re a minor celebrity . if you go on this thing , it could create a minor stir . bring that girlfriend of your and i ' ll only charge to <N> bucks . 
jerry : hey , how ' s business ? 
elaine : ooh , i ' ve got stump troubles . the sanitation department won ' t get rid of them all , i can ' t get a truck to haul this stuff until next week . meanwhile , i ' m sitting on a mountain of stumps . 
kramer : all right , i ' ve got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus . 
elaine : bus ? wait a minute , wait a minute , bus ? you ' ve got a bus ? 
kramer : yeah . 
elaine : you got any room on that thing ? 
kramer : yeah there are a few seats still available . 
elaine : do you think you could transport some stumps for me ? i ' ll make it worth your while . 
kramer : well , if they don ' t mind sitting in the back . 
elaine : no they don ' t . 
kramer : are they war veterans ? 
mary anne : wow this is your office . 
mr . steinbrenner : woah . hello . sorry george , didn ' t know you got a girl in here . give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something . come on george , help me out . 
mary anne : mr . steinbrenner , i would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at tyler chicken like our boy george here . 
mr . steinbrenner : hen supervisor from tyler chicken ? 
george : yes . very nice to have had her to mention starting to leave 
mr . steinbrenner : wait a minute george . 
george : be right with you . look mr . steinbrenner . 
mr . steinbrenner : moonlighting for tyler chicken . pretty impressive george . days with the new york yankees and nights in arkensas with a top flight bird outlet . and a hen supervisor to boot . i am blown . bloooown away . blown george . vibration in the o ' s bloooooooooooooooooooown . 
alex : you know when you make a pizza bagel , you really shouldn ' t use cinnimon rasin . 
jerry : you also shouldn ' t use a donut . 
kramer : all right ladies and gentlemen . welcome to the peterman reality tour 
tape player : turn music off . 
jerry : can we just go ? 
kramer : and go we will . 
man : what is this ? a piece of pound cake ? 
kramer : we have a bonus reality stop today . we will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository . 
man <N> : we ' re going to a garbage dump ? 
kramer : and we ' re off . 
jerry : you know i never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him , but this is pretty close . 
mr . steinbrenner : the back of his head to the camera john tyler ? george steinbreener here . i want to talk about george castanza . i understand he ' s been dividing his time between us and you . i cannot have that . 
john tyler : the back of his head also to the camera well i don ' t know who he is but if you want him that bad i ' m not giving him up that easily . 
mr . steinbrenner : oh is that so . playing a little hardball huh jonnyboy ? 
john tyler : how about this . you give me castanza , i convert your concessions to all chicken no charge . instead of hot dogs , chicken dogs . instead of pretzels , chicken twists . instead of beer , alcoholic chicken . 
mr . steinbrenner : how do you make that alcoholic chicken ? 
john tyler : let if ferment , just like everything else . 
mr . steinbrenner : that stuff sounds great . all right . i ' ll have costanza on the next bus . 
man : hey hey hey hey hey . where do you think you ' re going ? 
kramer : i was going to dump this . 
man : it doesn ' t look like garbage . 
kramer : well it ' s muffin stumps 
man : where are the muffin tops ? 
kramer : this is a garbage dump . just let me dump it . 
man : can ' t do it . 
kramer : is this a joke ? 
man : that ' s what i ' d like to know about it . 
alex : you have a pretty heavy beard , don ' t you ? 
jerry : what ' s that ? 
alex : well look it ' s almost time for you to shave again . 
jerry : oh . yeah . 
kramer : gets back on the bus , yelling well maybe i will take it up with consumer affairs . ladies and gentlemen you ' re in for an additional treat . we ' re going to extend the tour at no extra charge . 
man : where are we going ? 
kramer : looking at a map i don ' t know . over the speaker uh , no more questions . 
waitress : so , the new york yankees traded you for a bunch of tyler chicken . 
george : dogs , twists , a kind of fermented chicken drink . 
man : hey , aren ' t you the guy i asked to watch my clothes ? 
george : what clothes ? 
man : these clothes . the ones you ' re wearing . 
jerry : in low voice to next to kramer kramer how much longer ? my chest hair is comming back and it ' s itching me like crazy . i can ' t let her see me scratch it . 
kramer : don ' t worry . i ' ve got a good feeling about this dump . 
jerry : i ' m telling you man , i ' m losing it . 
jerry : i can ' t sit on this bus anymore . i think i ' ll go play with that dog . 
kramer : i don ' t know where the tops are . 
kramer : jerry what ' s the matter ? 
jerry : for the first half of the howl , a dog howls along with him . awoooooo oooooooo , that feels good . 
bartender : hey , you looking for george ? 
mary anne : yeah . 
bartender : he ' s been in the bathroom awhile . you might want to check on him . 
george : talking on the phone jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here . i lost my job with the yankees . i ' m standing in the men ' s room on <N>rd street in my underpants . 
mary anne : i told you this city would eat you alive . 
mr . lippman : what is this guy again ? 
elaine : they call him a cleaner . he makes problems go away . 
newman : hello elaine . where are they ? 
elaine : in the back . 
newman : all right , i ' m going to need a clean <N> ounce glass . 
mr . lippman : what is going on here ? 
newman : if i ' m curt , then i appologize . but as i understand it , we have a situation here and time is of the essence . 
 newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass . from the cooler he takes out <N> bottles of milk and sets them down . he bites into a stump , then takes a drink of milk from the glass . continuity error : he never actually poured the glass of milk . he swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows . he takes another stump . 
jerry : nah , you had a good run . took them to the world series . 
george : i got to give the players most of the credit for that . 
jerry : don ' t sell yourself short . you made all the flight arrangements , hotels , busses . 
george : no , i don ' t know who was doing that . 
jerry : so , when you actually did work , what it was that you did ? 
george : they had a pastry cart you wouldn ' t believe . 
lanette : here you go . your latt , your cappuccino . 
jerry : maybe i should ask her out ? 
george : she is a good waitress . 
jerry : that ' s true . maybe i take her to the tony ' s . 
george : you ' re going to the tony ' s ? 
jerry : yeah , i wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets . 
george : why didn ' t you ask me ? i know a million theater jokes . ' what ' s the deal with those guys down in the pit ? '

jerry : no , because that ' s 
george : no , listen ; we are always sitting here , i am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems . where do we end up ? 
jerry : here . 
george : exactly ! because neither one of us can ' t handle a woman all by ourselves . 
jerry : i ' m trying . 
george : i ' ve tried . we don ' t have it . but maybe the two of us , working together at full capacity , could do the job of one normal man . 
jerry : then each of us would only have be like a half man . that sounds about right ! 
mr . graham : i ' m sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award . but you didn ' t have anything to do with the actual production . 
kramer : no . 
mr . graham : i don ' t think there ' s no way how we can allow you to keep this tony . unless 
kramer : anything 
malcolm : are you familiar with our star , raquel welch ? 
kramer : oh yeah , she ' s fantastic . 
mr . graham : she ' s a train wreck . 
malcolm : there ' s a big tap dance number just before jean harris leaves the ? school to confront dr tarnover . 
mr . graham : it is a gut wrenching scene . 
malcolm : but , raquel welch doesn ' t move her arms when she tap dances . it ' s very distracting . 
mr . graham : there ' s lot of this swings his arms in tap dancing . 
kramer : so , you ' d like me to teach how to dance ? 
malcolm : no , we want you to fire her . 
jerry : why they want you to fire raquel welch ? 
kramer : because they ' re terrified of her . i heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines , she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads . story like that has got to be true . 
jerry : she seems very nice . 
kramer : jerry , you ' re not in show business . you don ' t know what these people are like . 
jerry : i ' m in show business . 
kramer : oh , come on ! what am i gonna do ? she ' s going to eat me alive . 
jerry : i ' ve got a tape of ' fantastic voyage ' if you think that would help . 
kramer : yayaya 
elaine : jerry , that crazy straight armed woman down at peterman ' s trashed my office . and then listen to this ; this is message she left me . 
sam ' s voice : elaine i am going to find you . if not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen 
elaine : she must ' ve got a blueprint of the building or something . 
jerry : did you tell peterman about this ? 
elaine : well , i tried , but he thought it was some sort of cat fight . 
kramer : cat fight ? 
elaine : ok , why ? why do guys do this ? what is so appealing to men about a cat fight ? 
kramer : yeye cat fight ! 
jerry : because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there ' s a chance they might somehow kiss . 
kramer : t t t t 
jerry : you got the tickets ? 
george : yeah , two for the <N> of novaj pravas ? . what you ' re wearing the green sweater ?

kramer : well , i i ms . welch i do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding , eh , your performance . 
raquel : what kind of problem ? 
kramer : well , it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television , carnivals , water parks 
raquel : out with it ! 
kramer : well , you ' re fired because you don ' t move your arms when you tap dance , you ' re like a gorilla out there i ' ve gotta go

kramer : leaving george , you listen to me . i owe ya one . 
jerry : he ' s incorrigible . you want to talk about it ? 
george : oh , please don ' t tell me you love me again , jerry , i can ' t handle it . 
jerry : george , letting my emotions out was the best thing i ' ve ever done . sure i ' m not funny anymore , but there ' s more to life than making shallow , fairly obvious observations . how about you ? 
george : all right here goes 
elaine : rabbi , is there anything i can do to combat this shiks appeal ? 
rabbi : ha ! elaine , shiks appeal is a myth , like the yeti , or his north american cousin , the sasquatch . 
elaine : well , something ' s goin ' on here , ' cause every able bodied israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop . 
rabbi : elaine , there ' s much you don ' t understand about the jewish religion . for example , did you know that rabbis are allowed to date ? 
elaine : about to leave well , what does that have to do ? 
rabbi : you know , a member of my congregation has a timeshare in myrtle beach . perhaps , if you ' re not too busy , we could wing on down after the high holidays ? elaine ? ' lainie ? 
george : so , that ' s it . all of my darkest fears , and everything i ' m capable of . that ' s me . 
jerry : yikes . well , good look with all that . 
george : where you going ? i i thought i could count on you for a little compassion . 
jerry : i think you scared me straight . 
elaine : all right , jerome , i ' m in . 
jerry : what ? 
elaine : maybe we should get married . maybe everything we need is right here in front of us . jer let ' s do it . 
jerry : i tell ya , i don ' t see it happening . 
elaine : what ? what happened to the new jerry ? 
jerry : he doesn ' t work here anymore . 
elaine : oh , well that ' s just *great ! * 
george : i love you , jerry . 
jerry : leaving right back at ya , slick . 
george : you know , all these years , i ' ve always wanted to see the two of you get back together . 
elaine : well , that ' s because you ' re an idiot . 
frank : you single handedly brought costanza and son to the brink of bankruptcy . 
george : well what about all the lloyd braun sales ? 
frank : he ' s crazy . his phone wasn ' t even hooked up . he just liked ringing that bell . 
estelle : i told you to clean out this garage . i have to put my car in ! 
frank : this is a place of business . i told you never to come in here . serenity now !

jerry : elaine , what do you think ? 
elaine : i think you ' re getting a little pudding under the skin yourself . 
kramer : my service rates went up ? you banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges . well , maybe i ' ll just take my blood elsewhere , yeah . 
bank employee : well , we can transfer to another bank for you . 
kramer : oh , no no no no more banks . i ' m keeping my blood in my freezer with my money ! 
george : so eh , what do you say ? 
tara : i guess we could use some food in our lovemaking . 
george : ok , we got your got your strawberries , your chocolate sauce , your pastrami on rye with mustard , your honey 
tara : wait wait wait , pastrami on rye with mustard ? 
george : oh yeah yeah , don ' t you know they used pastrami in that movie <N> ? weeks ? remember the pastrami scene ? 
tara : no . 
george : well , maybe it was ghostbusters ? where ever it was , it worked ! 
jerry : didn ' t go for it , huh ? 
george : no . 
jerry : so , she didn ' t appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats ? 
george : she tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce , but eh , it ' s not a meal , you know ? food and sex , those are my two passions . it ' s only natural to combine them . 
jerry : natural ? sex is about love between a man and a woman , not a man and a sandwich . 
george : jerry , i ' m not suggesting getting rid of the girl . she ' s integral . 
jerry : maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs , how about satisfying one of somebody else ' s . 
george : hey , speaking of which , i found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges ; exacto knife . 
jerry : i told you george , no more pudding . i ' m starting a purification program . keep all that kind of food away from me . 
george : well , i guess these would be out of the question . pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags . 
jerry : what the hell is that ? 
george : pudding skin singles . 
kramer : hey buddy , i ' m borrowing all your tupperware .

kramer : you know , for a fat guy you ' re not very jolly . 
elaine : hey , working out ? 
jerry : you know it and i ditched all my junk food .

jerry : sorry buddy , clean house . it ' s all health food . 
kramer : well , i may have to take it , but i don ' t have to like it . 
elaine : vivian left me a message . i guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone . 
jerry : is this about me ? 
elaine : no . 
jerry : oh , then i lost interest . 
elaine : vivian , hi it ' s elaine . yeah , i ' m over at jerry ' s , i got your message what ? yeah , he ' s right here , hold on hands the phone to kramer .
