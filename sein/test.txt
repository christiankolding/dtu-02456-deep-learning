george : summer of ' <N> i ' m at the beach . this family sits up next to me . i go in to the surfs and when i come from out , my clothes , my towel , my umbrella , they ' re all gone . i am furious , i start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally i lose it ; i grab their boom box and i chuck it in to the ocean . 
jerry : seems reasonable . 
george : then i see my clothes floating out there . the tied took them out , not the kids . 
jerry : even more reasonable . 
george : so now , the father is screaming at me , he ' s demanding that i pay for the boom box . finally , i gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there . 
jerry : and that guy is your new boss ? 
george : until that stupid photo jogs his memory . 
kramer : kruger ? that ' s not kruger industrial smoothing , is it ? 
george : yeah . 
kramer : grinders , sanders , wet stones . they are the ones who botched the statue of liberty job . 
jerry : right , they couldn ' t get the green stuff off . 
george : it is a horrible company . there ' s no management what so ever . i could go hog wild in there . 
kramer : you now what you do ? you sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed . 
george : like retouched . 
kramer : you remember that photo of me and gerald ford and i took it in . got that ford right out of there . 
george : oh , this is good . this kruger guy is clueless . i can ' t wait to work for him . 
kramer : look at this . this sandwich is terrible . everywhere you go , they give you this misshaped shardy meat . look at this 
kramer : i haven ' t had a decent sandwich in <N> years . 
jerry : neither have i . 
kramer : hey , our meat problems are solved . 
jerry : where did you get this thing ? 
kramer : i traded it to my sausage press . look how thin that is , see that ' s all surface area . the taste has nowhere to hide . 
elaine : hey . 
kramer : hey , spice . gives elaine a piece of meat . welcome to flavor country .

elaine : sara sitarides ? 
jerry : mmhu . 
elaine : oh falls in to the sofa . 
jerry : what ' s with you ? 
elaine : you remember that next door neighbor of mine , the apartment that always smells like potatoes ? 
jerry : your whole building smells like potatoes . 
elaine : this jackass goes to paris , leaves the alarm on . it ' s been beeping since <N> this morning . 
kramer : you know , that happened to lomez , so he blew his neighbor ' s circuit . 
elaine : how do you do that ? 
kramer : yeah well , that ' s easy . just let me finish this mile high and i ' ll be right with you . oh , and jerry , we are gonna need a case of kaiser rolls . 
jerry : i think we might have one left in the stock room . 
kramer : this hallway smells like potatoes . 
elaine : i know , i know , this is it . points to a door . 
kramer : ok , oh , you see this socket it ' s probably connected to her apartment . so what we ' ll do , we ' ll take this paper clip and bend it so it ' ll short out the entire circuit . here you go 
elaine : i think i ' ll let you do it . 
kramer : no no no . it ' s easy , you just do it quickly . 
elaine : no , i really don ' t want to .

jerry : well , i have this neighbor

kramer : this slicer is indomitable . 
jerry : where did you get that butcher ' s coat ? 
kramer : you buy enough meat , they ' ll give you anything . 
elaine : kramer , my neighbor has a cat . when you blew the power , we must ' ve shut off the automatic feeder . 
kramer : see , that ' s the same thing that happened to lomez . 
elaine : what did he do about it ? 
kramer : well , he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died . 
elaine : well , this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm . 
kramer : oh , that ' s a prickly one . 
elaine : yeah , how ' s the doctor date ? 
jerry : eh , died on the table . just spent hour and a half making me feel , if i don ' t save lives , i ' m worthless . 
elaine : well , she ' s very focused . dermatology is her life . 
jerry : dermatology ? 
elaine : yes , she ' s a dermatologist . 
jerry : saving lives ? the whole profession is ; eh , just put some aloe on it .

george : what , you ' re gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place ? 
jerry : revenge date ? that sound like you more than me . 
george : this good be so sweet , jerry . saving lives ? she ' s one step away working at the clinique counter !

george : but it ' s not a photograph , i need a photograph ! 
clerk : then you better get a camera .

george : i know . the only way to fix it now , is to get a whole new photo of kruger . 
jerry : you can do that . 
george : without his shirt on . 
jerry : you can ' t do that . well , maybe kruger wasn ' t the place for you . 
george : it seemed so disorganized . 
jerry : i understand . 
george : what about the coast guard ? seems like a lot of pride there , a lot of tradition . 
jerry : true . you mean , for you ? 
george : i think . 
jerry : what about your sea sickness ? 
george : maybe i could be a land guy . 
jerry : i don ' t know if they have land guys .

elaine : of course she treats skin cancer . that ' s how i met her , she was doing a skin cancer screening at peterman . that ' s what dermatologists do . 
jerry : sadly , that knowledge could ' ve help me . 
george : wait a minute , she did a skin cancer screening at peterman ? 
elaine : aha .

jerry : that ' s my hand towel ! i use that on my face , hands and chest ! that ' s where the hives are coming from ! it ' s not from dr . sitarides , it ' s from dr . van nostrand !

kruger : george , come in . i ' m just going over our annual report boy did we take it on the chin last year . 
george : eh , listen mr . kruger , i got a message from dr . van nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole . 
kruger : i ' m not too worried about it . 
george : well , he said it could be cancer , maybe you should get it checked out . 
kruger : george , take a look at this photo . this is taken <N> years ago . that mole looks exactly as it does today . so , there ' s no cause for concern , eh ? 
george : whatever . 
kruger : actually , funny thing about this photo . we were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by . when he went in for a swim , my sons and i took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean ! what a pear shaped loser . 
george : well , that pear shaped loser was me ! and i was in that photo , until i broke in here , stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there !

george : remember that new year ' s party he threw a few years ago ? he had that very drafty apartment , you know , i think on ninth avenue . 
elaine , becoming board : faster . 
george : i asked if i could borrow a sweater . 
jerry : a cashmere sweater . 
george : i said preferably cashmere , for warmth . so in front of the whole party , he says , ' no . i don ' t want you stretching out the neck hole . ' 
elaine : ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! 
george : oh , yeah , sure , laugh it up . everybody else did ! 
elaine : well , it ' s funny . i mean , you have a big head . or is it ' cause of your neck ? 
jerry : no , i think the head does most of the stretching . 
george : regardless . i had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap metlife windbreaker . now , it is payback time . 
elaine : i really think it ' s the size of your neck . 
george : it ' s my head ! 
elaine : ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! 
elaine : hey . 
peggy : hey . 
elaine : isn ' t this great ? with those nerds in accounting moved , you and i are the only ones who use this bathroom . 
peggy : somewhat sarcastically yeah . great . 
kramer : you went to the coffee shop without me ? i told ya , i just wanted to hop in the shower . 
jerry : that was an hour ago . what were you doing in there ? 
kramer : showering . how long does it take you ? 
jerry : ten minutes . 
kramer : seeing elaine come into jerry ' s apartment ten minutes ? that ' s kooky talk . hey elaine , how long do you spend in the shower ? 
elaine : ten minutes . 
kramer : let me smell you . 
elaine : all right . whiff away . 
kramer : after delicately sniffing elaine uh that ' s not bad at all . 
elaine : holding kramer off from getting another whiff hup ! that ' s it . 
kramer : backing off ok . 
elaine : so get this . i ' m in the bathroom at work today , and i see peggy using a seat protector . 
jerry : so ? 
elaine : so we ' re the only women on the floor . i mean , we ' re like roommates . would would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate ? 
jerry : seeing kramer struggle to open a soda , spilling it all over i think the damage is probably already done . interrupting kramer ' s inadequate attempt to clean up the soda all right ! i ' ll get that . well , maybe she just practices good hygiene . 
elaine : eyeing jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda yeah , you ' re probably right . she ' s probably one of those neurotic clean freaks . 
jerry : mmm . 
kramer : well , here ' s my shower routine . maybe i can make some changes . get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap , and just pop focus ! 
jerry : playing scrabble with his naked girlfriend zephyr ? that is not a word . 
melissa : do you challenge ? 
jerry : no , i do not challenge . 
melissa : <N> points . ha ha . 
jerry : i ' d accuse you of cheating , but i don ' t know where you ' d hide the tiles . 
melissa : you want some more ice tea ? 
jerry : sure . 
melissa : coughing loudly , while jerry ' s expression turns to disgust wrong pipe . 
george : so she coughed . 
jerry : coughing naked it ' s a turn off , man . 
george : everything goes with naked . 
jerry : when you cough , there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action . it ' s like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion . 
george : oh , you spoiled , spoiled man . do you now how much mental energy i expend just trying to picture women naked ? 
jerry : but the thing you don ' t realize is that there ' s good naked and bad naked . naked hair brushing , good ; naked crouching , bad . hey , there ' s hanke . 
george : all right . it ' s grovel time . 
hanke : hey , george . jerry . listen , i just got sober , so i ' ve been going through the twelve steps . 
george : what are you up to now , uh , step nine ? 
hanke : yeah . making amends . 
george : important step . maybe the most important . 
hanke : anyway , uh , jerry , you know , this may sound dumb , but , you know , when we first met i thought your name was gary . and , i think i may even have called you gary a couple of times , and i don ' t know if you noticed , but i always felt bad about it , so , i ' m sorry . 
jerry : thank you . i did notice , and i appreciate you rectifying it . 
hanke : eyeing george , who ' s looking expectedly up at him great . great . well , i ' ll see you guys later . 
kramer : enters well , i just got out of a <N> minute shower . i made some good cuts , and i didn ' t lose anything i needed . yeah , i think what i kept is even stronger now . 
jerry : pointing to kramer ' s hair you got some suds over here . 
kramer : noticing suds all over his clothes and body wha ? oh , man ! geez ! look at that ! i ' m all lathery . jerry , you got to show me what i ' m doing wrong . 
jerry : oh , come on ! 
kramer : no , i mean it , man . i ' m lost ! 
jerry : you promise you ' ll never come in here again ? 
kramer : chuckling oh , jerry , you know i can ' t do that . 
jerry : standing in the bathtub now my sense of it is that you ' re probably wasting time working piecemeal , first cleaning one area , then another . 
kramer : well , that ' s how cats do it . 
jerry : but , when you have a faucet instead of a tongue , you want to use gravity . 
kramer : ok . let ' s turn the water on now . 
jerry : no , i told you , it ' s just a dry run . 
george : entering jerry ' s bathroom well , hanke ' s moved on to step ten . he was spotted taking personal inventory . 
jerry : that ' s step ten ? 
george : all he has to do now is count his blessings , say a prayer , and he ' s done . do you believe this ? 
kramer : come on , jerry . how about a a baggy swimsuit ? 
jerry : you ' re not gettin ' any skin , kramer . 
kramer : well , this has all been one big tease ! 
elaine : moving peggy ' s water to make room for paper on the desk these proofs look pretty good . oh . can i move this ? yup . i think this will work . 
peggy : having seen elaine touch her nearly full water bottle i ' m gonna get another bottle of water . 
walter : taking a final swig from his own water bottle here , take mine . there ' s a little left . 
peggy : gulping down walter ' s water oh , thanks , walter . ahh ! 
hanke : talking with two men in monk ' s guys , there ' s no doubt that the pay is good . but i don ' t just know if i see myself working with ice cream . 
man #<N> : you get pretty buff forearms . 
hanke : i don ' t know if i ' m into that . 
george : entering monk ' s oh , hello , hanke , others . 
hanke : george . 
george : you know , jason , i , uh , i couldn ' t help notice , i i didn ' t get my apology . 
hanke : apology ? for what ? 
george : a drafty apartment ? a sweaterless friend ? a ball game giveaway metlife windbreaker ? 
hanke : george , come on , not that neck hole thing . 
george : yeah , the neck hole thing , and i would appreciate it if you would say you ' re sorry . 
hanke : no way , you would ' ve completely stretched it out . 
george : you ' re an alcoholic ! you have to apologize . step nine ! step nine . 
hanke : all right , george , all right . i ' m sorry . i ' m very , very sorry . i ' m so sorry that i didn ' t want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal size neck hole of my finely knit sweater . 
kramer : taking notes on showering men at the ymca now see , that ' s smart . constant motion . wow . 
man in shower : seeing kramer staring at the showering man hey ! 
kramer : oh , yeah , yeah , i i ' m watching you , too . but this guy ' s really showing me something !

jerry : so now you want an apology for the apology , plus the original apology ? 
george : that ' s right . i ' m two in the hole ! 
jerry : well , i hit the wall yesterday with lady godiva . she did a full body flex on a pickle jar .

george : it doesn ' t matter if it ' s more comfortable . it ' s wrong .

elaine : ahan , ahan . yeah euh but , why is it that the , that the animals enjoy reading the email ? 
mr . elinoff : well miss benes . cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn ' t dissect gossamer . heh . hemm .

mr . elinoff : it ' s a slice of life . 
elaine : no it isn ' t .

jerry : aw . right , code of silence . how ' s that going ? . ha ! !

sally : jerry , sorry i ' m late . channel nine is doing a piece on my show . isn ' t that great ? do you hate me ? 
jerry : no , no i tought the show was terrific . i was just wondering if you have to keep saying jerry seinfeld is the devil .

jerry : i know but i thought that maybe you could mention how i apologized then encouraged you to stick with it . 
sally : you know i workshopped that and . snoozers ! he he he . but i ' ll tell you what i ' ll think it ' s all a journey .

driver : where to ? 
george : we hear him think my friends are idiots , she doesn ' t look like jerry . she doesn ' t look like anybody . and so what if does look like jerry , what does that mean ? . that i could have everything i have with jerry but because it ' s a woman i could also have sex with her . and that somehow that would be exactly what i always wanted . she doesn ' t even look like jerry . 
sally : you know i really do look like your friend jerry .

kruger : according to our latest quarterly thing , kruger industrial smoothing is heading into the red . or the black , or whatever the bad one is . any thoughts ? 
george : well , i know when i ' m a little strapped , i sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it . that could buy us some time . 
kruger : works for me . good thinking , george . 
co worker #<N> : alright , george .

george : i had ' em , jerry . they loved me . 
jerry : and then ? 
george : i lost them . i can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it ' s buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns . 
jerry : showmanship , george . when you hit that high note , you say goodnight and walk off . 
george : i can ' t just leave . 
jerry : that ' s the way they do it in vegas . 
george : you never played vegas . 
jerry : i hear things . 
elaine : here ' s one . i borrowed puddy ' s car and all the presets on his radio were christian rock stations . 
george : i like christian rock . it ' s very positive . it ' s not like those real musicians who think they ' re so cool and hip . 
elaine : so , you think that puddy actually believes in something ? 
jerry : it ' s a used car , he probably never changed the presets . 
elaine : yes , he is lazy . 
jerry : plus he probably doesn ' t even know how to program the buttons . 
elaine : yes , he is dumb . 
jerry : so you prefer dumb and lazy to religious ? 
elaine : dumb and lazy , i understand . 
george : tell you how you could check . 
elaine : how ? 
george : reprogram all the buttons , see if he changes them back . you know ? the old switcheroo . 
jerry : no , no , the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person ' s . 
george : no , it ' s doing the same thing to someone that they did to you . 
jerry : yeah , elaine ' s gonna do the same thing to puddy ' s radio that the radio did to her . 
george : well that ' s the gist of it ! 
elaine : quiet ! so where is this sophie ? 
jerry : oh , she ' s picking me up in a few minutes . 
elaine : how long have you two been together ? 
jerry : i dunno . since the last one . oh , here she is . you wanna meet her ?

jerry : hey mickey . check the pepper shaker . 
kramer : yeah . inhales some pepper then sneezes violently see ? it should sound like that , something like that . 
mickey : aah choo . 
kramer : a little wetter . see , i didn ' t believe it . 
jerry : what ' s with the fake sneezing ? 
kramer : yeah , we ' re going down to mt . sinai hospital , see they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing . 
mickey : they assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms . it ' s an easy gig . 
jerry : do medical schools actually do this ? 
kramer : well the better ones . alright , let ' s practice retching . 
kramer & mickey : huaahhh ! ! 
jerry : i think the phone is ringing . 
kramer & mickey : huaahhh ! !

jerry : oh , i knew it was you , i was joking . i ' m a comedian . 
kramer : you got any ipecac ? 
jerry : ipecac ? kramer , i really think you guys are going too far with this . 
kramer : no , mickey , he swallowed twelve aspirin . 
jerry : did he overdose ? 
kramer : no , it ' s just too much . 
kruger : and it gets worse . the team working on the statue in lafayette square kind of over smoothed it . they ground the head down to about the size of a softball , and that spells trouble . 
george : alright , well why don ' t we smooth the head down to nothing , stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to ichabod crane ? 
george : getting up and leaving alright ! that ' s it for me . goodnight everybody . 
dr . wexler : in your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit . 
mickey : bacterial meningitis . jackpot ! 
kramer : gonorrhea ? you wanna trade ? 
mickey : sorry buddy , this is the hamlet of diseases . severe pain , nausea , delusions , it ' s got everything . 
man : sure . 
kramer : okay , what do you got ? 
man : the surgeon left a sponge inside me . 
kramer : good luck with that . 
george : i knew i had hit my high note so i thanked the crowd and i was gone . 
jerry : what did you do the rest of the day ? 
george : i saw titanic . so that old woman , she ' s just a liar , right ? 
jerry : and a bit of a tramp if you ask me . 
elaine : hello boys . 
george : hey , so , did you give that radio the old switcheroo ? 
elaine : i did . 
george : and the christian rock ? 
elaine : ressurected ! and look what i pried off of his bumper , a jesus fish ! 
george : jerry , do you have any fishsticks ? 
jerry : no . so you ' re disappointed he ' s a spiritual person ? 
elaine : well yeah , i got him because he seemed so one dimensional , i feel misled . 
george : i think it ' s neat . you don ' t hear that much about god anymore . 
jerry : i hear things . hey , so sophie gave me the it ' s me on the phone today . 
elaine : it ' s me ? isn ' t it a little premature ? 
jerry : i thought so . 
elaine : hah . she ' s not a me . i ' m a me . 
george : i ' m against all it ' s mes . so self absorbed and egotistical , it ' s like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes ! 
kramer : well , i got gonorrhea . 
elaine : that seems about right . 
kramer : that ' s what they gave me . 
george : they ? the government ? 
jerry : no , no . he ' s pretending he ' s got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it . 
kramer : and it ' s a waste of my talent . it ' s just a little burning . mickey , he got bacterial meningitis . 
george : i guess there are no small diseases , only small actors . 
george : leaving alright that ' s it for me . good night everybody . 
elaine : what was that ? 
jerry : showmanship , george is trying to get out on a high note . 
kramer : see , showmanship . maybe that ' s what my gonorrhea is missing . 
jerry : yes ! step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row . 
kramer : yes , yes i will ! i ' m gonna make people feel my gonorrhea , and feel the gonorrhea themselves . 
student #<N> : and are you experiencing any discomfort ? 
kramer : just a little burning during urination . 
student #<N> : okay , any other pain ? 
kramer : the haunting memories of lost love . may i ? signals to mickey lights ? mickey turns down the lights and kramer lights a cigar our eyes met across the crowded hat store . i , a customer , and she a coquettish haberdasher . oh , i pursued and she withdrew , then she pursued and i withdrew , and so we danced . i burned for her , much like the burning during urination that i would experience soon afterwards . 
student #<N> : gonorrhea ? ! 
kramer : gonorrhea ! 
jerry : one message . hope it ' s not from you . 
answering machine : hey jerry , it ' s me . call me back . 
jerry : sophie . 
george : she ' s still doing that ? 
jerry : yep . 
george : alright , i ' ll tell you what you do . you call her back and give her the it ' s me , heh ? pull the old switcheroo . 
jerry : i think that ' s a what ' s good for the goose is good for the gander . 
george : what the hell is a gander , anyway ? 
jerry : picking up the phone and dialing it ' s a goose that ' s had the old switcheroo pulled on it . hi sophie , it ' s me . 
sophie : hey raef . 
jerry : to george she thinks it ' s someone named raef . 
george : good , let her think it . 
jerry : into the phone , with a disguised voice so , what ' s going on ? 
sophie : not a lot . 
george : ask about you , ask about you .

sophie : oh , i really like him but , well , i still haven ' t told him the tractor story .

puddy : feels like an arby ' s night . 
elaine : arby ' s . beef and cheese and do you believe in god ? 
puddy : yes . 
elaine : oh . so , you ' re pretty religious ? 
puddy : that ' s right . 
elaine : so is it a problem that i ' m not really religious ? 
puddy : not for me . 
elaine : why not ? 
puddy : i ' m not the one going to hell . 
george : you know what i think ? i bet she stole a tractor . 
jerry : no one ' s stealing a tractor , it ' s a five mile an hour getaway . we ' re dancing around the obvious , it ' s gotta be disfigurement . 
george : does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need ? 
jerry : no , she looks completely normal . 
george : oh . okay , here it is , i got it . she lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on . they do it every day . 
jerry : you think she ' s got toes for thumbs ? 
george : how ' s her handshake ? a little firm , isn ' t it ? maybe a little too firm ? 
jerry : i don ' t know . 
george : hands a little smelly ? 
jerry : why do i seek your counsel ? 
elaine : well i ' m going to hell . 
jerry : that seems about right . 
elaine : according to puddy . 
jerry : hey , have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and 
elaine : i ' m not in the mood . 
george : to a passing waitress i ' ll have some coffee and a doughnut . 
jerry : what do you care ? you don ' t believe in hell . 
elaine : i know , but he does . 
jerry : so it ' s more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul . 
elaine : well , relationships are very important to me . 
jerry : maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity . 
george : to the waitress bringing his doughnut and a slice of devil ' s food cake . 
george : hey . where is everyone ? 
kruger : they ' re all off the project . they were boring . george , you are my main man . 
george : i am ?

george : why don ' t you think before you do something ? 
elaine : here ' s a thought bye bye .

jerry : hey hey hey ! 
george : what ? 
jerry : where do you think this relationship is ? if you are thinking of instituting an open door urination policy , let me disabuse you of that notion right now , my friend .

stu : how you been ? 
jerry : good , good . you remember george . 
stu : george , good to see you . 
george : hello stu . 
stu : you remember jay crespi . 
george : jay crespi , how am i gonna forget jay crespi ? 
stu : this is james kimbrough . 
kimbrough : nice to meet you , pleasure , thanks for coming in . 
george : kimbrough . 
jerry : don ' t spell . 
george : k i m b r o u g h 
kimbrough : that ' s right . 
george : it ' s a talent i have . 
kimbrough : why don ' t we sit down , glad you ' re here . 
george : woo ! some day out there you ever see weather like that ? woo ! it ' s crisp it ' s crispy crisp . 
jerry : shut up , george . 
kimbrough : can i get you anything ? 
george : what do we have in the fruit department ? 
jerry : oy . 
stu : pineapple . 
george : oh , that ' s a dangerous fruit . it ' s like a weapon that thing , got spikes on the end . you can get killed from one of those things . 
kimbrough : anyway , let me tell you why i called . when i took over here last month , i reviewed what was in development , and it was pretty much same old , same old . 
george : been there , done that . 
kimbrough : right . i was looking for something different . something that would have people talking at the water coolers . 
george : water coolers ? 
crespi : we call it a water cooler show . 
jerry : because the next day in the offices , people gather around the water coolers to talk about it , right ? 
george : see , i think people would talk about it at the coffee machines . 
jerry : well it ' s probably just easier to say water cooler show than coffee machine show . 
george : it ' s really not accurate . nobody drinks from a water cooler any more they use bottles . 
jerry : but i think mr . kimbrough makes a good point . 
kimbrough : anyway , stu here started telling me about a show , jerry , that he developed five years ago . 
stu : i have always loved it . 
kimbrough : he said it was a show about nothing . so , i saw the pilot and i ' ve got to tell you i flipped out . 
crespi : he totally flipped out . 
kimbrough : what i want to do is put it on the air . <N> episode commitment . start it off on wednesday night , build up an audience . this show needs time to grow . i love that kramer guy . 
jerry : he ' s a little off the wall . 
crespi : oh yeah . 
stu : kramer . 
kimbrough : and elaine i wouldn ' t mind seeing something happening between you two . 
jerry : definitely . 
george : i tell you , i really don ' t think so called relationship humor is what this show is all about . 
kimbrough : or we could not do the show altogether , how about that ? 
george : or we could get them together . woo ! 
george : yeah ! 
jerry : yeah ! 
elaine : jill , hi , it ' s elaine . well , i ' m calling from my home . indoors . well , i was just calling to see how your fa . i ' m sorry , i ' m getting another call . hang on just a second . hello ?

jerry : jill ? well , why didn ' t you say so ? 
elaine : you said it was an emergency .

helen : congratulations , they ' re doing the show . 
morty : they should have put that show on <N> years ago . bunch of idiots at that network . can i tell you something , jerry ? it ' s all crap on tv . the only thing i watch is xena the warrior princess . she must be about six six .

george : ma ? ! 
estelle : i don ' t know how you ' re going to write all those shows . and where are you get all the ideas ? 
frank : would you leave him alone ? you ' ll shatter his confidence ! 
george : i don ' t need any ideas . it ' s a show about nothing . 
estelle : nothing . please . i ' ll tell you the truth the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me . 
jerry : nbc is letting me use their private jet ? and i can go anywhere i want ? that ' s fantastic ! thanks . great . okay , bye .

elaine : this is all very exciting . 
george : so ? where are we going ? 
kramer : i say japan . 
elaine : why japan ? 
kramer : oh geishas they cater to your every whim . they ' re shy at first , but they ' re quite skilled at conversation . they can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing or baking . 
elaine : oh i got it how about russia ? 
jerry : russia , it ' s so bleak . 
elaine : it ' s not bleak it ' s springtime . 
jerry : it ' s still bleak .

newman : i was speaking earlier with kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to paris ? 
jerry : yeah , that ' s right . 
newman : well , i hear it ' s quite beautiful there this time of year , and of course you know i ' m one quarter french . 
jerry : really . 
newman : oh yes , in fact i still have family there . this probably won ' t interest you , but i have a cousin there who ' s suffering very badly . she ' s lost all use of her muscles . she can only communicate by blinking . i would so love to see her bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life . but alas , i can ' t afford it , for i am , as you know , but a simple postal worker . 
jerry : that ' s a shame . 
newman : take me ! take me ! 
jerry : oh , forget it . pull yourself together . you ' re making me sick . be a man ! 
newman : all right ! but hear me and hear me well the day will come . oh yes , mark my words , seinfeld your day of reckoning is coming . when an evil wind will blow through your little playworld , and wipe that smug smile off your face . and i ' ll be there , in all my glory , watching watching as it all comes crumbling down .

george : i ' m sorry i have to say , i ' m a little disappointed , i thought it would be a lot nicer . 
jerry : you ' re complaining about a private jet ? 
george : you think this is the plane that ted danson gets ? 
jerry : ted danson is not even on the network anymore . 
george : still , i bet when they gave him a plane , it was a lot nicer than this one . 
elaine : will you shut up ? you are ruining the whole trip . 
george : this is a real piece of junk . i don ' t even feel safe on this thing . i have a good mind to write a letter tomr . kimbrough . 
jerry : you ' re not writing any letters ! 
elaine : will you turn around ? 
george : why ? 
elaine : you are annoying me sitting like that . it ' s effeminate .

george : how is this effeminate ? 
elaine : i don ' t know it just is . 
george : kramer , what are you doing ? 
jerry : still got water in your ear ? 
kramer : can ' t get rid of it . maybe it leaked inside my brain .

vogel : officer , he ' s stealing my car ! officer , i was carjacked . i was held up at gunpoint ! he took my wallet , everything !

jerry : under arrest ? what for ? 
officer : article <N> <N> of the latham county penal code . 
elaine : what ? no , no we didn ' t do anything . 
officer : that ' s exactly right . the law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it ' s reasonable todo so . 
george : i never heard of that . 
officer : it ' s new . it ' s called the good samaritan law . let ' s go . 
elaine : the good samaritan law ? are they crazy ? 
george : why would we want to help somebody ? 
elaine : i know . 
george : that ' s what nuns and red cross workers are for . 
kramer : the samaritans were an ancient tribe very helpful to people . 
elaine : alright um , excuse me , hi , could you tell me what kind of law this is . 
deputy : well , they just passed it last year . it ' s modeled after the french law . i heard about it after princess diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around . 
jerry : oh , yeah . 
elaine : oh , yeah . 
deputy : you ' re the first ones to be arrested on it , probably in the whole country . 
george : all right , so what ' s the penalty here ? let ' s just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here . 
deputy : well , it ' s not that easy . now see , the law calls for a maximum fine of $<N> , <N> and as much as five years in prison . 
elaine : what ? 
george : oh no no no no we have to be in california next week . we ' re starting a tv show . 
deputy : california ? oh gosh , i don ' t think so . yeah , my guess is you ' re gonna be prosecuted . better get yourselves a good lawyer . 
chiles : who told you to put the cheese on ? did i tell you to put the cheese on ? i didn ' t tell you to put the cheese on . 
secretary : jerry seinfeld on the phone . 
chiles : you people with the cheese . it never ends . hello ? uh huh . uh huh . uh huh . good samaritan law ? i never heard of it . you don ' t have to help anybody . that ' s what this country ' s all about . that ' s deplorable , unfathomable , improbable . hold on . suzie , cancel my appointment with dr . bison . and pack a bag for me . i want to get to latham , massachusetts , right away . 
hoyt : so they got jackie chiles , huh ? sets down the newspaper uh hmm . you know what that means . this whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over . you ' re not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town . the whole country is going to be watching us . now we got to do whatever it takes to win it , no matter what the cost . the big issue in this trial is going to be character . i want you to find out everything you can about these people and i mean everything . 
kramer : mmmm , this is pretty good chow , huh ? 
george : would it kill him to check up on us ? no drops off the meals and that ' s it . i realize we ' re prisoners , but we ' re still entitled to catsup . 
elaine : i guess we could ' ve called for help . 
jerry : but then we would have missed the whole thing . 
kramer : i still had it on video . we could have watched it later . 
george : yeah , he ' s right . 
jerry : i forgot about the video . 
elaine : sure the video . 
elaine : what is that ? 
jerry : plane ' s ready . 
rivera : hi everybody , i ' m geraldo rivera . tonight we ' ll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes , and around the water coolers in your offices . i am speaking of course of the controversial good samaritan trial that gets underway thursday in latham , massachusetts . now before we meet our distinguished panel , let ' s go to latham live , where jane wells is standing by . jane 
wells : yes . good evening , geraldo . 
rivera : what ' s the mood ? what ' s going on tonight ? 
wells : well , latham is fairly quite tonight , considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town . 
rivera : and what about the defendants the so called new york four . how are they holding up ? 
wells : well , i did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them , and he told me quote there ' s no love lost with that group . 
rivera : anything else , jane ? 
wells : there also seems to be some friction between mr . seinfeld , and ms . benes . the rumor is that they once dated , and it ' s possible that ended badly . 
rivera : well , ladies and gentlemen , who know , maybe this trial will bring them closer together . maybe they ' ll even end up getting married . 
helen : i hope you packed enough this trial could last for weeks . 
morty : what ' s all that ? 
helen : cereal . 
morty : you ' re packing cereal ? 
helen : i ' m bringing it for jerry . 
morty : you got enough here for a life sentence . 
helen : he likes it . he says he misses that more that anything . 
morty : so bring a snack pack . 
estelle : poor georgie , was it our fault this happened to him ? did we do something wrong ? maybe it was our fault . 
frank : maybe it was your fault . it wasn ' t my fault . i can tell you that . 
estelle : oh , so it was my fault , but not yours . 
frank : you were the one who smothered him . 
estelle : i did not smother him . 
frank : you smothered ! he couldn ' t get any air ! he couldn ' t breathe ! he was suffocating ! 
estelle : sure , and you were always in korea with your religious chachkis . 
frank : i had to make a living ! 
kramer : this is excellent huh ? don ' t worry i didn ' t use too much milk , cause i know we gotta make it last . 
jerry : you know i ' ve had to reduce my milk level . my whole life i ' ve always filled to at least three quarters sometimes , to the top of the cereal . now , to conserve , i can ' t even see the milk anymore . it ' s a big adjustment . 
kramer : i bet . 
jerry : it ' s one of the hardest things i ' ve ever had to do . 
chiles : good morning . 
elaine : good morning , jackie . 
jerry : good morning . 
chiles : is everybody ready ? didn ' t i tell you i wanted you to wear the cardigan ? 
george : it makes me look older . 
chiles : look older ? do you think this is a game ? is that what you think this is ? i ' m trying to give you amoral compass . you have no moral compass . you ' re going to walk into that courtroom , and the jury ' s going to see a mean , nasty , evil george costanza . i want them to see perry como . no one ' s going to convict perry como . perry como helps out a fat tub who ' s getting robbed . 
chiles : do you think it ' s funny ? 
jerry : no . 
chiles : you damn right it isn ' t . you better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom , funny man . cause if you start getting all smart alecky , making wisecracks , acting a fool , you gonna find yourself in here for a long , long time . i don ' t like that tie . suzie , get one of my ties from my briefcase . 
elaine : how do i look , jackie ? 
chiles : oh , you looking good . you look strong . you one fine looking sexy lady . 
elaine : thank you , jackie . 
kramer : how bout me , jackie ? 
chiles : kramer , you always look good . you got respect for yourself . you ' re genuine . jury ' s going to pick up on that . 
chiles : here . 
jerry : this one ? 
chiles : that ' s right . 
jerry : do i have to ? 
elaine : jackie says put it on , jerry . 
bailiff : all rise . fourth district county court , latham , massachusetts is now in session . the honorable judge arthur vandelay presiding . 
george : vandelay ? the judge ' s name is vandelay ? 
chiles : vanda who ? 
george : jerry , did you hear that ? 
jerry : yeah . 
george : i think that ' s a good sign . 
vandelay : is the district attorney ready to proceed ? 
hoyt : we are , your honor . 
vandelay : mr . hoyt . 
hoyt : ladies and gentlemen , last year , our city council by a vote of twelve to two , passed a good samaritan law . now , essentially , we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble . now this group from new york not only ignored , but , as we will prove , they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint . i can guarantee you one other thing , ladies and gentlemen , this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner . on the contrary , they have quite a record of mocking and maligning . this is a history of selfishness , self absorption , immaturity , and greed . and you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused , wronged , deceived and betrayed . this time , they have gone too far . this time they are going to be held accountable . this time , they are the ones who will pay . 
vandelay : mr . chiles . 
chiles : i am shocked and chagrined , mortified and stupefied . this trial is outrageous ! it is a waste of the taxpayers ' time and money . it is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing lying and laughing , laughing and lying . you know what these four people were ? they were innocentbystanders . now , you just think about that term . innocent . bystanders . because that ' s exactly what they were . we know theywere bystanders , nobody ' s disputing that . so how can a bystander be guilty ? no such thing . have you ever heard of a guilty bystander ? no , because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty . bystanders are by definition , innocent . that is the nature of bystanding . but no , they want to change nature here . they want to create a whole new animal the guilty bystander . don ' t you let them do it . only you can stop them . 
vandelay : is the prosecution ready to present its first witness ? 
hoyt : we are , your honor . call officer matt vogel to the stand . 
bailiff : call matt vogel . 
hoyt : so they were just standing there ? 
vogel : yes . 
hoyt : did one of them have a video camera ? 
vogel : yes . 
hoyt : your honor , with the court ' s permission , we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as exhibit a . 
vandelay : proceed . 
vogel : don ' t shoot . 
jerry : well , there goes the money for the lipo . 
elaine : see , the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it ' s an easy getaway . they can ' t really chase ya ! 
george : he ' s actually doing him a favor . it ' s less money for him to buy food . 
new witness : the victim of the robbery 
hoyt : so they just stood there and did nothing ? 
vogel : yeah , nothing . nothing ! 
hoyt : no further questions . 
george : hey ! great plane ! thanks a lot . piece of junk . you know you almost got us killed ! 
hoyt : call mabel choate to the stand . 
bailiff : call mabel choate . 
chiles : your honor . i most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness . she was not present at the time of the incident . her testimony is irrelevant , irrational , and inconsequential . 
hoyt : your honor , the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses . it is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident . it ' s part of a pattern of anti social behavior that ' s been going on for years . 
vandelay : objection overruled . i ' ll hear the witness . 
hoyt : now , mrs . choate , would you please tell the court what happen the evening of january <N>th . 
choate : well , i was in snitzer ' s bakery when i got accosted by that man . 
hoyt : let the record show that she is pointing at mr . seinfeld . 
hoyt : what did he want ? 
choate : my marble rye . 
hoyt : your marble rye ? 
choate : i got the last one . he kept persisting , and i said no . 
hoyt : and then you left the bakery . 
choate : that ' s right . 
hoyt : but it didn ' t end there , did it , mrs . choate ? 
choate : oh no . 
jerry : gimme that rye . 
choate : stop it . 
jerry : i want that rye lady . 
choate : help someone help . 
jerry : shut up , you old bag ! 
hoyt : no further questions . 
hoyt : i call marla penny to the stand . 
bailiff : call marla penny . 
jerry : the virgin ! 
hoyt : and what was your connection to the defendants ? 
penny : i dated mr . seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of <N> . 
hoyt : then on the evening of october <N> , there was an abrupt end to that relationship . tell us what happened . 
penny : it ' s rather difficult to talk about . 
hoyt : it ' s alright . take your time . 
penny : well , i became aware of a 
hoyt : a what ? 
penny : a , uh 
hoyt : yes ? 
penny : a contest . 
hoyt : contest ? 
penny : yes . 
hoyt : what was the nature of the contest ? 
penny : oh please , i can ' t . 
hoyt : it ' s okay . 
penny : the four of them made a wager to see if they could 
hoyt : yes ? 
penny : to see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves . 
peterman : for the love of god ! 
penny : it was horrible , horrible ! 
hoyt : call donald sanger to the stand . 
jerry : who the hell is that ? 
mr . sanger : come on donald , you ' re doing fine . 
george : the bubble boy ! 
chiles : bubble boy ?

chiles : what ' s a bubble boy ? 
jerry : he ' s a boy who lives in a bubble . 
bubble boy : what the hell are all you looking at ? 
hoyt : so donald , would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house , october <N>th , <N> . 
bubble boy : well , jerry seinfeld was supposed to come to my house , but his friend costanza showed up instead , so i challenged him to a game of trivial pursuit . 
george : who invaded spain in the eighth century ? 
bubble boy : that ' s a joke the moors . 
george : oh no i ' m so sorry , it ' s the moops . the correct answer is the moops . 
bubble boy : moops ? let me see that . that ' s not moops , you jerk . it ' s moors . it ' s a misprint . 
george : sorry , the card says moops . 
bubble boy : it doesn ' t matter . it ' s moors there ' s no moops . 
george : it ' s moops . 
bubble boy : moors ! 
george : moops ! 
george : help ! someone ! 
bubble boy : there ' s no moops , you idiot . 
susan : stop it ! let go of him ! 
mrs . sanger : donald , stop it . no . donald , stop it . 
george : it was moops . 
bubble boy : moors . 
new witness : the lady kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in the handicapped spot 
hoyt : so mr . costanza parked in a handicapped spot , and as a result you got in an accident , and your wheelchair was destroyed ? 
lady : that ' s right . 
hoyt : and then mr . kramer gave you a used wheelchair ? 
lady : that ' s right . 
new witness : dr . wilcox , the doctor on duty when susan died 
hoyt : so you were the doctor on duty the night susan ross died ? 
wilcox : yes , that ' s right . it was may <N> , <N> . i ' ll never forget it . 
hoyt : so you broke the news to mr . costanza ? could you tell the court , please , what his reaction was ? 
wilcox : i would describe it as restrained jubilation . 
mr . ross : murderer ! 
mrs . ross : he killed our daughter ! he knew those envelopes were toxic ! 
vandelay : order in this court ! 
hoyt : call sidra holland to the stand . 
chiles : whew ! look at this one , she fine . you dated her ? 
hoyt : so you met jerry seinfeld in a health club sometime in <N> ? 
sidra : yes . 
hoyt : and you also met miss benes in that same health club ? 
sidra : yes , that ' s true . 
hoyt : would you describe the circumstances of that meeting . 
sidra : we were in the sauna , making chit chat . 
sidra : you know , i ' ve seen you around the club . my name ' s sidra . this is marcie . 
elaine : oh , hi , i ' m elaine . 
hoyt : so , she pretended to trip , and she fell into your breasts ? 
sidra : yes .

george : fire ! get out of the way ! 
new witness : parking lot security guard 
guard : at the time , i was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the garden valley shopping mall . 
jerry : why would i do it unless i was in mortal danger ? i know it ' s against the law . 
guard : i don ' t know . 
jerry : because i could get uromycitisis poisoning and die that ' s why . 
hoyt : uromycitisis ! i wonder if they ' re having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial ? perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom ! 
chiles : objection , your honor ! this is completely inappropriate ! my clients ' medical condition is not on trial here ! i refer you to the disability act of <N> . 
vandelay : sit down , mr . chiles . 
new witness : police detective 
hoyt : alright , detective , then what happened ? 
detective : we got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot .

rivera : hi everybody , i ' m geraldo rivera and welcome to this special edition of rivera live . well , arguments in the good samaritan trial ended today . the jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now . let ' s go live to jane wells who is in latham , massachusetts , covering this trial for us . jane 
wells : geraldo , just a few minutes ago , the jury asked to see the video tape . 
rivera : that ' s the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery . 
wells : yes , it ' s a very incriminating piece of evidence . but i must tell you , geraldo , this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people . one even had the feeling that if judge vandelay didn ' t finally put a stop to it , it could ' ve gone on for months . 
rivera : jane , whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury ? 
wells : that is so hard to say . certainly there ' s the doctor with the poison invitations . the bubble boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure . and that bizarre contest certainly didn ' t sit well with this small town jury . there ' s the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to , the deported pakistani restaurateur . geraldo , it just went on , and on , and on , into the night . 
rivera : and so we wait . 
jerry : do they make you wear uniforms in prison ? 
elaine : i think so . 
jerry : it ' s not that bright orange one is it ? 
elaine : i hope it ' s not that one , because i cannot wear orange . 
kramer : will you stop worrying ? jackie ' s going to get us off . he never loses . how about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house . did you see the look on his face ? 
estelle : sorry to bother you , judge . 
vandelay : how did you get in here ? 
estelle : please , if he ' s found guilty , please be kind to him . he ' s a good boy . 
vandelay : this is highly irregular . 
estelle : well , maybe there ' s something i can do for you . 
vandelay : what do you mean ? 
estelle : you know 
sidra : oh , jackie , you ' re so articulate . 
chiles : we have plenty of time , too . this jury could be out for days . 
chiles : hello ? damn . they ' re ready . 
jerry : hey elaine , what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down ? 
elaine : i ' ve always loved united airlines . 
kramer : i think it ' s going to be okay that girl just smiled at me . 
jerry : maybe because she knows you ' re going to jail . 
bailiff : all rise . 
vandelay : ladies and gentlemen of the jury , have you reached a verdict ? 
foreman : we have , your honor . 
vandelay : will the defendants please rise . and how do you find , with respect to the charge of criminal indifference ? 
foreman : we find the defendants guilty . 
vandelay : order ! order in this court , i will clear this room ! i do not know how , or under what circumstances the four of you found each other , but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built . i can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves . i know i will . this court is adjourned . 
george : you had to hop ! you had to hop on the plane . 
elaine : puddy , don ' t wait for me . 
puddy : alright . 
frank : we gotta get out of here . we want to beat the traffic . 
sidra : come on , jackie . let ' s go . 
jerry : what ? 
chiles : oh , and by the way , they ' re real , and they ' re spectacular . 
jerry : well , it ' s only a year . that ' s not so bad . we ' ll be out in a year , and then we ' ll be back 
kramer : could be fun . don ' t have to worry about your meals , or what you ' re going to do saturday night . and they do shows . yeah , we could put on a show maybe bye bye birdie or my fair lady . elaine , you could be liza doolittle . 
elaine : why don ' t you just blow it out your a 
elaine : if i call jill from prison , do you think that would make up for the other ones ? 
jerry : sure . 
elaine : cause you only get one call . the prison call is like the king of calls . 
jerry : i think that would be a very nice gesture . 
kramer : i got it it ' s out ! how about that , huh ? oh , boy , what a relief . 
jerry : see now , to me , that button is in the worst possible spot . 
george : really ? 
jerry : oh yeah . the second button is the key button . it literally makes or breaks the shirt . look at it , it ' s too high , it ' s in no man ' s land . 
george : haven ' t we had this conversation before ? 
jerry : you think ? 
george : i think we have . 
jerry : yeah , maybe we have . 
jerry : so what is the deal with the yard ? i mean when i was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard . but of course she didn ' t have to worry about my next door neighbor tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh . and what ' s with the lockdown ? why do we have to be locked in our cells ? are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison , in prison ? you would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough . so , anyone from cellblock d ? 
prisoner <N> : i am . 
jerry : i ' ll talk slower . i ' m kidding i love cellblock d . my friend george is in cellblock d . what are you in for , sir ? 
prisoner <N> : murder one . 
jerry : murder one ? oooooo , watch out everybody . better be nice to you . i ' m only kidding sir lighten up . how about you , what are you in for ? 
prisoner <N> : grand theft auto . 
jerry : grand theft auto don ' t steal any of my jokes . 
prisoner <N> : you suck i ' m gonna cut you . 
jerry : hey , i don ' t come down to where you work , and knock the license plate out of your hand . 
guard : alright , seinfeld , that ' s it . let ' s go . come on . 
jerry : alright , hey , you ' ve been great ! see you in the cafeteria .
