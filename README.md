# Project made for DTU's deep learning class 
See more info about the class [here](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456).
The purpose of the project is to implement [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182v1.pdf).
Setup is initially based on [this](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model) PyTorch language model example.
